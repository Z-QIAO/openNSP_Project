# openNSP_Project
This open-source project aims to create a CAD file of the Northumbrian small-pipes using OpenSCAD. The CAD file is intended for research and experimental purposes, providing an accurate and modifiable 3D model based on historical measurements and chanter data. Different presets can be loaded and shared under the same licence, allowing for a collaborative and evolving design process.

## Overview

The Northumbrian small-pipes are a distinctive type of bagpipes native to Northumberland. This project utilises OpenSCAD, a script-based 3D CAD modeller, to create a detailed and accurate model of the instrument. The measurements and chanter data used in this project were provided by [Mike Nelson](https://www.machineconcepts.co.uk/smallpipes/pipe2.htm).

## Features

- **Detailed Modelling:** Accurate representation of the Northumbrian small-pipes based on traditional measurements.
- **OpenSCAD Script:** Easily modifiable script for customising and experimenting with different aspects of the design.
- **Adjustable Design:** Design can be adjusted on the fly for various research and experimental needs.
- **Preset Support:** Different presets can be added for analysis, allowing for comprehensive study and comparison.
- **Easy Sharing:** Models, codes and presets can be easily shared with the community.
- **GPL v2 License:** The project is released under the GNU General Public License v2, ensuring that it remains free and open-source.

## Roadmap

The project is continuously evolving, and the following features are planned for future releases:

- **Drones and Blowpipes:** Addition of detailed models for drones and blowpipes to complete the Northumbrian small-pipes set.
- **Left-handed Version:** Development of a left-handed version of the small-pipes to accommodate different player preferences.
- **Key Designs:** Introduction of various key designs to provide more options for customisation.
- **Modular Keys Options:** Implementation of modular key options to allow easy swapping and experimentation with 7-key, 9-key, 11-key, 14-key and more configurations.
- **Undercuts and angled holes:** Incorporation of undercuts and angled holes for improved acoustic performance and historical accuracy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/downloads.html): Ensure you have the latest version of development built OpenSCAD installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Z-QIAO/openNSP_Project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd openNSP_Project
    ```

### Usage

1. Open the `openNorthumbrianChanter.scad` file in OpenSCAD:

    ```bash
    openscad openNorthumbrianChanter.scad
    ```
3. View, modify, and render the 3D model as needed.
4. Export the model to your preferred 3D file format for further use or 3D printing.
